# Specific ignore for GitHub Pages
# GitHub Pages will always use its own deployed version of pages-gem
# This means GitHub Pages will NOT use your Gemfile.lock and therefore it is
# counterproductive to check this file into the repository.
# Details at https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/768
Gemfile.lock
